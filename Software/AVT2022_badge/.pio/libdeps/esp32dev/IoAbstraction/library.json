  "description": "Interchange between PCF8574, MCP23017, 74HC595, and regular pins. Fully debounced switches, rotary encoders, joystick encoder emulation (including on DfRobot), matrix keypads/keyboards, and touch screen input on any IO device that require no extra components in most cases. An EEPROM abstraction that works with AVR & I2C AT24x ROMs.",
